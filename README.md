# Data-Structure
Data Structures Programs Using C.

Day 1 (Sparse Matrix and Matrix Manipulations):-

  1. Write functions to give a compressed storage representation of a sparse matrix and also find the
     transpose of the sparse matrix (using the compressed representation).
  2. Write functions to check whether a matrix is i) Lower triangular, ii) Upper triangular, iii) Diagonal,
     iv) Identity, v) Tridiagonal. Dynamic memory allocation to be used for creating matrices

Day 2(Searching and Polynomial Representation):-

  1. Write functions to implement
      a. Linear search on an array
      b. Linear search with sentinel on an array
      c. Binary search (iterative)
  2. Write functions to perform the following
      a. Represent a polynomial (of single variable x)    
      b. Add two polynomials
  
Day 3 (Stack and Its Applications):-
  
  1. Write a menu driven program to implement a stack (use an array to store the elements of the stack).
  2. Write functions to convert an infix expression to its corresponding postfix expression.
  
Day 4 (Queue and Its Types):-
  
  1. Write a menu driven program to implement a simple/linear queue (use an array to store the elements of the queue).
  2. Write a menu driven program to implement a circular queue (use an array to store the elements of the queue).
  3. Write a menu driven program to implement a deque using array.
  
Day 5 (Singly Linked List)

  1. Write a menu driven program to implement a singly linked list with the following operations
    a. Insert an element at any position (front, end or intermediate)
    b. Delete an element from any position (front, end or intermediate)
    c. Display the list
    d. Perform a linear search on the list.
    e. Insert an element after a specified element
    f. Delete a specified element
    g. Count the number of nodes
    h. Reverse the list, so that the last element becomes the first, and so on
    b. Concatenate two lists

Day 6 (Doubly and Circular Linked List)

  1. Write a menu driven program to implement a doubly linked list with the following operations
    a. Insert an element at any position (front, end or intermediate)
    b. Delete an element from any position (front, end or intermediate)
    c. Display the list

  2. Write a menu driven program to implement a circular linked list with the following operations
    a. Insert an element at any position (front, end or intermediate)
    b. Delete an element from any position (front, end or intermediate)
    c. Display the list
